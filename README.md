# BU-CS526-DATA-STRUCTURES-AND-ALGORITHMS-Final-Project

This project is an implementation of a small simulation program. It is a simulation of a process scheduler of a computer system. This simulated scheduler is a very small, simplified version, which reflects some of the basic operations of a typical process scheduler.
